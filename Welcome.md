#  Welcome to Pythonista

Thank you for downloading Pythonista! You now have everything you need to build and run Python scripts directly on your iPhone or iPad. 

To give you an idea of what you can do with the app, various sample scripts are included in the *Examples* folder. Feel free to use them as starting points for your own experiments. To share your creations, get help with coding problems, or just to meet fellow Pythonistas, please visit our [community forum](http://forum.omz-software.com).


#  Getting Started

If you're new to Pythonista, here are some tips to help you get up and running:

*	To create a new script, first tap `â‰¡` to reveal the library, then `+` (at the bottom). You can also use left and right swipe gestures to switch between the file browser, editor, and console panels.

*	The settings ("gear" button in the file browser) contain useful options to customize the editor font, color theme, indentation type (tabs/spaces), and much more.

*	Swipe left to show the **console** panel. This is where text output appears, and you can use the prompt at the bottom to evaluate individual lines of Python code directly.

*	You'll also find the included **documentation** in the console panel; simply tap the `(?)` button to open it in a separate tab. Reference documentation is also available while you're editing code -- simply select a word (e.g. a function name), and choose *Helpâ€¦* from the menu.

*	For easier navigation in long scripts, tap the file name at the top to show a list of classes and functions. This is also where you can rename the current file.

*	If you enjoy coding in Pythonista, please consider leaving a rating or [review in the App Store][review]. Thank you!

#  Tips

*	Tap and hold the run (â–·) button for some additional options, e.g. to pass arguments (`sys.argv`) to your scripts, or to run the integrated PEP8 style checker.

*	Tap the *Edit* button in the "wrench" menu to add your own script shortcuts there. You can use this to launch your favorite scripts more quickly, or to extend the editor's functionality with the `editor` module.

*	A lot of keys on Pythonista's extra keyboard row have multiple mappings. For example, you can tap and hold the tab key to get an unindent option.

*	Tap with two fingers in the editor to select an entire line of code.

*	You can run Pythonista scripts directly within other apps that support the standard iOS share sheet. To get started, open the share sheet in a supported app (e.g. Safari, Notes, Maps...) and select "More..." to add the Pythonista action extension. You can use the `appex` module to access data that was passed to the share sheet (e.g. the current URL in Safari, location data in Maps, etc.).

*	If you use Pythonista with an external (Bluetooth) keyboard, you can show a list of available shortcuts by pressing and holding the `Cmd` key.

*	Swipe left on a file in the script library to open it in a new tab or move it to the trash. 


#  What's New in 3.2

For full release notes, and to see what was added in previous releases, please refer to the "What's New in Pythonista" page in the documentation. You can also open the release notes from an empty tab. The following are just the highlights: 

*	You can now sync your scripts via iCloud Drive, and open Python files from other apps.

*	Pythonista now uses Python 3.6. Among other things, this enables the use of f-strings for easier string formatting.

*	Files in the script library can be moved via drag'n'drop (requires iOS 11).

*	The "Convert Tabs" feature is now called "Reformat Code", and supports applying coding style guidelines, in addition to converting indentation.

*	Improved search in the script library and documentation.

*	Improved support for the iPhone X.

*	The tab bar UI is now the same on iPhone and iPad.

*	The Python interpreter is now built with IPv6 support (this should fix connectivity issues users were experiencing with some cellular providers).
